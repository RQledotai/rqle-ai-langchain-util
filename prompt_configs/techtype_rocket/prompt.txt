**Inputs:**
* `target_audience` (str) = {target_audience} - A string describing the intended readers of the post (e.g., "business leaders").
* `target_word_count` (int) = {target_word_count} - The minimum desired word count for the entire blog post.
* `topics` (List[str]) = {topics} - A list of strings representing the key subjects the blog post should cover (e.g., ["social media marketing", "content strategy"]).

**Outputs:**
* **title**: A creative and engaging title for the blog post, using the `topics` and targeting the `target_audience`. The title should be under 100 characters.
* **content**: This will be the entire written content of your blog post in Markdown format, with a total word count as close as possible to the `target_word_count`. It will include:
    * **introduction:** A brief introduction that provides context and introduces each topic in the topics list.
    * For each topic in `topics`:
        * **tagline:** A concise and impactful phrase summarizing the main point of the section.
        * **text:** A list of informative and engaging paragraphs written in active voice, using transitions and examples.
            * The number of paragraphs and their length will be adjusted to achieve the target word count while providing sufficient details without repetition. Aim for at least 3 well-structured paragraphs with multiple sentences per paragraph.
    * **conclusion:** A concluding section that summarizes the key takeaways from the post and includes a Call to Action (CTA) related to the topics discussed.
* **seo_tags:** A list of 5 relevant SEO tags related to the `topics` to improve search engine discoverability.

**Formatting:**
* Markdown format for proper content structure (refer to [Markdown Guide][markdown_guide]).

**Considerations:**
* I will prioritize achieving the `target_word_count` as closely as possible.
    * If the initial generation falls short, I will strategically expand on complex topics or add details to specific sections.
    * If the initial generation exceeds the target, I will condense sections while maintaining clarity and key information.
* **Avoid using bullet points or numbered lists.**
* The content should be well-written, original, and insightful.
* The writing style and tone should be appropriate for the `target_audience` and the `topics` covered.
