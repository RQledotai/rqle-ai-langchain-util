# Installing `langchain-util` Library

## Install from GitHub

Installing directly from GitHub is useful when a release has not yet been cut with the changes pushed to a branch that you need. Non-released versions may include breaking changes, and may not yet have full test coverage. We recommend using a released version whenever possible.
```
pip install langchain_util
```
