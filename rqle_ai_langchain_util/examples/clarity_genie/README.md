## Description <a name="description"></a>
Prompt engineering is the art of crafting instructions to get the most out of generative AI models. By designing 
specific prompts, you can steer the AI towards generating the desired creative text formats, translating languages, 
or writing different kinds of creative content

**RQle.AI** is introducing **ClarityGenie** as your one-stop shop for crafting powerful prompts through revision and 
refinement by a Large Language Model (LLM). This is accomplished by:
* **Enhanced Clarity**: ClarityGenie analyzes your input prompt and suggests improvements, ensuring your AI tools 
  understand your intent perfectly.
* **Context is King**: ClarityGenie helps you provide the context AI needs to deliver exceptional results, 
  tailored exactly to your vision.

ClarityGenie return its output in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/), which has been known to 
yield better results than plain text.
